# Ensemble_Learning_Bagging
# First i load "diabetes.csv" and check if there is any missing value """df.isnull().sum()"""
# I also look at descripiton of my "df" "mean" "std" itd. """df.describe()""" and use method "value_counts" on my "Outcome" column """df.Outcome.value_counts()"""
# Now i need to create my "X" and "y" as column "Outcome" """X = df.drop('Outcome', axis = 'columns')""" """y = df.Outcome"""
# Then i make "feature scaling", so I import "StandardScaler" from "sklearn.preprocessing" and "scale" my "X" """X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)"""
# Next I can import "train_test_split" and get "train" and "test" set, my "X" is "X_scaled" and I use parameter "stratify" on "y" its "labels array"
# I check shape of my "X_train" and "X_test" and I use method "value_counts" on my "y_train"
# Then I import "classifier" from "sklearn.tree" I import "DecisionTreeClassifier" and from "sklearn.model_selection" I import "cross_val_score"
# I put into "cross_val_score" "DecisionTreeClassifier", "X", "y" and set  number of iteration at (5), then I get "mean" of my scores "scores.mean()"
# Next from "sklearn.ensemble" I import "BaggingClassifier" and prepare "bag_model"
# My "base_estimator" will be "DecisionTreeClassifier" numbers of "trees" "n_estimators" (50), "max_samples" at (0.8) and "max_samples" at "True"
# Then i train my "bag_model" "bag_model.fit(X_train, y_train)" and get score "bag_model.oob_score_"
